A discord bot that can move users from one channel to another. Inlcuding locked and hidden voice rooms!

### Installing

Start by installing node.js

After that, install the requirements by running ```npm install```

Then open the project folder and rename example.config.js to config.js and replace x with your Developer Bot token.

Finally run ```npm start```

### Deploy using docker

Start by renaming the example.config.js to config.js and replace x with your Developer Bot token
```
docker build -t moveer .
docker run --restart always -d -e TZ=Your/Timezone moveer
```

### How to operate the bot using commands.

** You can only move people if they are in the Moveer/gMoveer channel unless you have access to "#adminmoveer" text channel, (then you can move them from any voicechannel). **

1. If you want to move a single user they will have to join the voice channel called "Moveer". Then use the command ```!move @username.``` (Notice that you can also tag multiple people and it will still move all of them).

2. Instead of using many @tags to move people you can use our group function! In order for this to work you will have to create a voice channel called "gMoveer [insert name here]" then use the command ```!gmove [name of the channel].```

3. In order to use the "admin" version of the bot you will have to create a text channel named "adminmoveer". In this textchannel the bot will move people with the command ```!move @username``` (can be more than 1 user) even if they aren't in the "Moveer" channel.
