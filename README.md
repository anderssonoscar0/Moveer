A bot that moves users from one voice channel to another. Including locked and hidden voice channels!

## We currently got 4 commands that all move users in different ways.


### **!cmove:** ↓ 
Moves users spread across multiple voice channels to one without the need of joining a voice channel. <br>(Command must be sent inside a text channel named "moveeradmin")
<br>Example command: `!cmove channel#1 @user1 @user2`.

### **!move:** ↓

Moves @mentions of users inside the Moveer voice channel to you. User1 is required to be inside the “Moveer” voice channel.
<br>Example command `!move @user1 @user2`


### **!gmove:** ↓
Moves users inside  GmoveerX to you with one command. If the voice channel is named gmoveerPubg use the example command
<br>Example command `!gmove pubg`
 

### **!fmove:** ↓ 
Moves users inside one voicechannel to another. Moves users inside overwatch to pubg. <br>(Command must be sent inside a text channel named "moveeradmin")
<br>Example command `!fmove overwatch pubg`


# Notes:
1. If your voice channel contains spaces use `!fmove "channel 1" "channel 2"`
2. `!fmove` and `!cmove` are both admin commands and requires the command to be sent inside a text channel named "moveeradmin"
3. `!gmove` and `!move` commands sent inside "moveeradmin" moves people from any channel and removes the requirement to be inside "Moveer" or "Gmoveer". Please note that the !gmove will require the full name of the voicechannel.
